 *       https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-OPLL/blob/master/roms/ym2413_std.c
 *   - Based on actual ROM dump from YM2413 chip
 *   - Also referenced by other emulators (e.g., MAME, openMSX, VGMTrans, y8950)
 * Notes:
 *   - Each preset: 8 bytes [modulator(4), carrier(4)]
 *   - Array index: [0]=Violin (Preset 1), [1]=Guitar (2), ..., [14]=SynthBell (15), [15]=User patch (default/empty)
 *   - Rhythm instrument voices are included as a separate array.
